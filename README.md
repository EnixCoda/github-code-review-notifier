### Connect GitHub account

Click `Link` in the menu to link your GitHub account to the Slack workspace. Only linked users will get notifications. So don't forget to tell your teammates about this tool.

### Connect GitHub projects

You can click `Setup GitHub projects` in the menu to get a webhook for connecting your GitHub projects.

- [How to use GitHub webhook?](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/developers/webhooks-and-events/creating-webhooks)
- The events sent to it should at least include `Pull requests` and `Pull request reviews`. Or `Send me everything` for easier setup.
- The URL is bound to the workspace. And multiple projects can share one URL in one Slack workspace.
